Some rules for contributing to this project:

* Please open a separate issue for each problem, question, or comment you have.
  Do not re-use existing issues for other topics, even if they are similar. This
  keeps issues small and manageable and makes it much easier to follow through
  and make sure each problem is taken care of.

* We'd love for you to send pull requests for fixes you have made or new features
  you have added. Please read the [notes for developers](NOTES_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md)
  beforehand which contains some coding guidelines.
