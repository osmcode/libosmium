             * This abstract class defines an interface to storage classes
             * intended for storing small pieces of data (such as coordinates)
             * indexed by a positive integer (such as an object ID). The
             * storage must be very space efficient and able to scale to billions
             * of objects.
             *
             * Subclasses have different implementations that store the
             * data in different ways in memory and/or on disk. Some storage
             * classes are better suited when working with the whole planet,
             * some are better for data extracts.
             *
             * Note that these classes are not required to track "empty" fields.
             * When reading data you have to be sure you have put something in
             * there before.
             *
             * A typical use for this and derived classes is storage of node
             * locations indexed by node ID. These indexes will only work
             * on 64 bit systems if used in this case. 32 bit systems just
             * can't address that much memory!
             *
             * @tparam TKey Key type, usually osmium::object_id_type, must be
             *              an integral type.
             * @tparam TValue Value type, usually osmium::Location or size_t.
             *                Copied by value, so must be small type.
